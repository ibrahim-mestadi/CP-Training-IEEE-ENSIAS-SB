### Problem: Happy Birthday, Polycarp!
Hooray! Polycarp turned n

years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!

Polycarp celebrated all of his n
birthdays: from the 1-th to the n

-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?

According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 1
, 77, 777, 44 and 999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 12, 11110, 6969 and 987654321

.

Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).

Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 1
to n

(inclusive) that are beautiful.
Input

The first line contains an integer t
(1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t

test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer n
(1≤n≤109) — how many years Polycarp has turned.
Output

Print t
integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 1 and n, inclusive.
